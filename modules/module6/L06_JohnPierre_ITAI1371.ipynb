    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Answer the following questions in this markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **In your own words, what is the key difference between a regression problem and a classification problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is basically trying to predict some number on a continuous scale, like predicting how much something will cost or what temperature it'll be. Classification is different because you're trying to predict which category something falls into, like whether something is yes or no, spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The `LinearRegression` model has an attribute called `.coef_`. After you train the model, print `lr_model.coef_`. What do these numbers represent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.coef_` values are the slopes for each feature. They tell you how much each feature influences the prediction. So, if the coefficient for Age is 2, that means for every year older a passenger is, the predicted fare goes up by 2 dollars. A bigger coefficient means that feature has a bigger impact on the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Why did we use `mean_squared_error` to evaluate the regression model but `accuracy_score` for the classification model?** Why wouldn't accuracy be a good metric for the fare prediction task?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they're measuring different things. For regression, we care about how close we are to the actual value. If we predicted $50 and it was actually $54, we want to measure that difference. But for classification, you're either right or wrong. Accuracy makes sense there because it's just the percentage of correct guesses. For fare prediction, accuracy doesn't make sense because the prediction is a continuous number, not a category."
