## Prerequisites

To run the notebooks and code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common machine learning libraries (specific requirements may vary by module):
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jpierre-7/ITAI_ML_FirstRepo_JohnPierre.git
   cd ITAI_ML_FirstRepo_JohnPierre
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Navigate to the relevant module folder or notebook to access the coursework:

- For Module x materials: `cd modulex`
  - For example for Module 3: `cd module3`
- To experiment: open `test_notebook.ipynb`

Each module folder contains its own notebooks and supporting files with specific instructions and exercises.

## Course Information

This repository is part of an Introduction to AI/Machine Learning course, ITAI 1371 at Houston City College. The materials cover fundamental concepts and practical applications of machine learning algorithms.

## Notes

- The `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder is automatically generated by Jupyter and contains backup copies of notebooks
- Make sure to keep your notebooks saved regularly while working
- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, check that you're using compatible versions of the required libraries

## Contributing

As this is a personal coursework repository, contributions are not expected. However, suggestions and discussions about the implementations are welcome through GitHub issues. Please let me know if I've missed anything.
